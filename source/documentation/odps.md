Supporting material on what these are and how you should use them can be read [here](https://medium.com/kainos/you-must-think-first-before-you-move-7ac4af0346a9) and a guideline for what to include is available [here](https://github.com/KainosSoftwareLtd/opendesignproposals/blob/master/001-odptemplate.md)

It is often useful to conduct a tech spike to evaluate a design proposal.

Read more about doing this [here](https://medium.com/kainos/spikes-8a502bc0b93c)

Once a design proposal has been evaluated and decided upon it's good to create a corresponding Decision Record.
