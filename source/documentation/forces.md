# Architectural Forces
Outline pressures and constraints that influence decisions for this delivery. This can include financial, technological, chronological or otherwise.

## Architetural Goals
Based on the forces outlined, what are the goals that the architecture must  meet. Typically these will be the 'illities' of the architure for example:

_deployability, scalability, efficiency, predictability, portability, securability_

These goals should be measured by fitness functions.

## Fitness Functions
> _An architectural fitness function provides an objective integrity assessment of some architecctural characteristic(s)_

> Rebecca Parsons, Neal Ford, Patrick Kua

These are tests that can be put in place to measure the success of the implementation from a holistic perspective.

Document these tests here, or link to their execution in your pipeline.
