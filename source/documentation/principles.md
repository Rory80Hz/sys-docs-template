# Architectural Principles
List the principles you have agreed that guide decision making for the delivery of this product or service.

You _must_ include the rationale, implications and applicabiliy of each principle.

Principles are not law. They should be referenced in ODPs and Decision Records, if a princinple is violated, then reasoning should be provided. If a principle is continuously violated, then it probably no longer holds.

Include no more than 10 to 15. Otherwise you are probably overcomplicating things.

## Example: Speed of Delivery over Architectural Purity
#### Rationale
Service must be delivered in short timescale, it is a proof of concept.

#### Implications
Quality standards will be reduced, technical debt may be significant. Work may be throwaway.

####  Applicability
Design and implementation of all new system components.
