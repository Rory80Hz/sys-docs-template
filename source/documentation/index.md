# System Name Here

## Purpose and Scope
Give us a high level overview of what this project is and why it exists.

In this document, we will offer several different viewpoints on the system so that each member of the delivery team and live operations teams have a shared understanding of the system.

##Â Delivery Approach
We are using a cross functional agile approach to delivery, which means all disciplines are represented in delivery teams.

We will be talking a DevOps approach to implementation, which includes fully automated testing, deployment, and security testing. Teams are fully responsible for taking code from development through to the live platform. This will be covered in the deployment, development and operational views.
