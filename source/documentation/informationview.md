# Information/Data View

## Information/Data Principles
### Example: Relational Database Schema Management is automated.
#### Rationale
Manual updates to schema result in system unpredictability and fragility, and can result in significant failure or delay to delivery.

#### Implications
All schema changes must be captured in code, versioned and deployed automatically via the deployment pipeline.

This must be checked as part of any code review, and tested appropriately.

#### Applicability
All changes to relational data schema.
