## Example: Set up your development environment
Document steps required to run a local development setup. Instructions on running services locally _must_ also be availble in any README in the source code control repositories. If it is more convenient just link to them.

### Java code formatting

Use Google Java Format for all Java code.

For IntelliJ IDEA there is the google-java-format (1.5.0.172) plugin for Java code formatting.

To use it you will need to:

- Install it via Preferences --> Plugins --> Browse repositoriesâ€¦
- Enable it via Preferences --> Other Settings --> google-java-format Settings (use Default Google Java style)
- Use CTRL+ALT+O and ALT-CMD-L for each Java change to format the code and remove unused imports

### Install Docker

Go to [Docker Downloads](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac) and download the appropriate platform package for your system.
Next, Install these packages according to the instructions for your operating system.
